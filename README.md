## Features

* **Context-aware chunking** ‚Äì splits long files into overlapping text blocks to preserve context while respecting model token limits.
* **Multilingual support** ‚Äì uses a blank spaCy *xx* pipeline for lightweight sentence segmentation in any language.
* **LLM-powered correction** ‚Äì each chunk is sent to an Ollama model (`gemma3n` by default) for plain spelling, accent and basic formatting fixes **without** re-writing style or meaning.
* **Smart overlap merge** ‚Äì similarity matching (via `difflib`) removes duplicate sentences between consecutive chunks.
* **CLI-ready** ‚Äì run the script directly from the command line with a single command.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ruj89/text-fixer-ollama
cd text-fixer-ollama

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt      # or: pip install ollama spacy

# Make sure the Ollama server is running, then pull the model you want
ollama serve             # starts the local Ollama daemon (if not already running)
ollama pull gemma3n       # download the default model

# Correct a file
python correttore.py input.txt output.txt
```

<a id="installation"></a>

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**

   * Python ‚â• 3.9 (tested with 3.11)
   * [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) installed and the `ollama` CLI available in your `$PATH`.
   * A local model compatible with your hardware (default: `gemma3n`).

2. **Set up a virtual environment** *(recommended)*

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *`requirements.txt`*

   ```text
   ollama>=0.5.1
   spacy>=3.8.7
   ```

4. **Download (or change) the model**

   ```bash
   # List available local models
   ollama list

   # Pull gemma3n (default used in the script)
   ollama pull gemma3n
   ```

   > **Tip:** You can change the model by editing the `MODEL_NAME` constant in *correttore.py*.

## Usage

```bash
python correttore.py <input_file> <output_file>
```

Examples:

```bash
# Correct a plain-text novel\python correttore.py war_and_peace.txt war_and_peace_fixed.txt

# Overwrite the original (‚ö†Ô∏è irreversible!)
python correttore.py draft.md draft.md
```

Upon completion you will see progress messages like:

```
üìù Correcting chunk 3/12 ‚Ä¶
‚úÖ Done! Output in: corrected.txt
```

## Configuration

Tweak the top-level constants in *correttore.py* to fit your project:

| Constant             | Purpose                                          | Default     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `CHUNK_CHARS_LIMIT`  | Max characters per chunk sent to the LLM         | `2500`      |
| `OUTPUT_PERCENT`     | % of the chunk written before the overlap begins | `50`        |
| `OVERLAP_PERCENT`    | Chunk overlap (derived from `OUTPUT_PERCENT`)    | `50`        |
| `MODEL_NAME`         | Ollama model to use                              | `"gemma3n"` |
| `MISMATCH_THRESHOLD` | Allowed mismatch between overlapping segments    | `0.05`      |

> **Note:** If you set a far smaller `CHUNK_CHARS_LIMIT`, the script will run more requests but use less GPU/VRAM per call.
